Lumoria Celestial Alignment - Detailed Report
============================================

System Planets:
- Mercuria: 0.4 AU, 4,879 km
- Venusia: 0.7 AU, 12,104 km
- Earthia: 1.0 AU, 12,742 km
- Marsia: 1.5 AU, 6,779 km

Alignment & Shadow Analysis:
- Planets are sorted by distance from the sun.
- Shadows are cast by larger, closer planets onto those farther away.
- Mercuria receives full light (no closer planets).
- Venusia is partially shadowed by no larger planet, so receives full light.
- Earthia is shadowed by Venusia (larger & closer), so receives partial light.
- Marsia is shadowed by both Venusia and Earthia, so receives multiple shadows (none).

Scientific Improvements:
- Shadow cones are now calculated using angular diameter and distance.
- Partial shadowing is determined by overlap of shadow cones.
- Light intensity is proportional to the visible solar disk fraction.

Animation:
- See the SVG for a static alignment. For animation, use a web viewer to animate planet positions and shadow cones over time.

Custom Systems:
- The system supports any number of planets with user-defined distances and diameters.

Unit Testing:
- See test file for light intensity logic validation.
